    $textToScan = "Hello world, this is a test.";
    $base64Content = base64_encode($textToScan);
    $scanId = time();

    // Configure the scan
    $webhooks = new SubmissionWebhooks($WEBHOOK_URL);
    $properties = new SubmissionProperties($webhooks);
    $properties->setSandbox(true); // Turn on sandbox mode for testing

    require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

    use Copyleaks\Copyleaks;
    use Copyleaks\CopyleaksNaturalLanguageSubmissionModel;

    // --- Your Credentials ---
    $EMAIL_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS';
    $KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
    $WEBHOOK_URL = 'https://your-server.com/webhook/{STATUS}';
    // --------------------

    $sampleText = "Lions are social animals, living in groups called prides, typically consisting of several females, their offspring, and a few males. Female lions are the primary hunters, working together to catch prey. Lions are known for their strength, teamwork, and complex social structures.";

    $submission = new CopyleaksNaturalLanguageSubmissionModel(
      $sampleText,
    );
    $submission->sandbox = true;

    $response = $this->copyleaks->aiDetectionClient->submitNaturalLanguage($authToken, time(), $submission);
    $this->logInfo('AI Detection - submitNaturalLanguage', $response);

```

                    labels: labelsArray
    );

    $response = $this->copyleaks->textModerationClient->submitText($authToken, time(), $model);
    $textModerationResponse= CopyleaksTextModerationResponseModel::fromArray(json_decode(json_encode($response), true));

    $this->logInfo('Text Moderation - submitText', $textModerationResponse);
